# Builds the GHCR image (docker-publish.yml, multi-arch amd64+arm64 via buildx).
# The HA add-on PULLS this prebuilt image, so there's no per-arch build override any more —
# always the slim base. BUILD_FROM stays overridable for ad-hoc local builds only.
# 🔴 Moving this to 3.13 or later: Python 3.13 turns VERIFY_X509_STRICT on by default in
# ssl.create_default_context(), and Leapmotor's certificates cannot pass it — their app-gateway
# server certificate carries basicConstraints CA:FALSE together with keyCertSign, which strict
# verification refuses ("Key usage keyCertSign invalid for non-CA cert"), and so does the
# application certificate in certs/. It is a template error across their PKI; nothing here can
# reissue either. Measured 28/09/2026 against the live gateway on one OpenSSL (3.6.3): 3.12
# completed the handshake, 3.14 refused it. The cloud client clears the flag explicitly for its
# own pinned-CA context (leapmotor_cloud.transport.tls_context, mate-api 0.1.0a12), so a bump is
# safe — but if every cloud call ever dies at stage=transport right after one, this is why.
