"""The research probe captures the whole mileage/energy/detail reply (beta #10 / #11).

Why this probe exists: on a range-extender the "Avg consumption" on the cumulative card is the
electricity divided by a distance that was *partly driven on petrol*. @michapr's own car reports
12.6 kWh/100 km over its electric kilometres where Mate reports 8.9 over all of them, and the split
that would reconcile the two (his dashboard says 58 % electric / 42 % fuel) is in none of the
endpoints we had ever captured. mileage/energy/detail is the only remaining candidate — and the live
call reads `totalEnergy` and `totalmileage` and drops the rest of the reply where it stands, so
nobody has ever seen what else is in there. These tests pin the two things that would silently make
the probe useless: the key going missing from the bundle, and the request losing the signed
begin/end window (without it the cloud answers with mileage only).
