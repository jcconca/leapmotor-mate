"""The day drawer carries that day's own totals (#175 @ghuaywen-ai).

Not a new idea: the year/month/day accordion the calendar replaced (68ff5e7) showed distance, ♻️ regen,
cost and a weighted efficiency on every one of its three levels. The calendar kept the month line and
dropped the day one, which is what @ghuaywen-ai noticed — he reported a number that had gone missing,
not a feature he wanted invented.

Two things are worth pinning down here. Efficiency is a DISTANCE-WEIGHTED mean, so a 2 km hop can't
drag the day's figure around the way a plain average would. And the day line must come out of the same
arithmetic as the month line above it: they sit centimetres apart, and two implementations of the same
mean eventually disagree.
