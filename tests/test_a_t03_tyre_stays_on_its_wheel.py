"""A T03's tyre pressures must land on the wheels they are named after.

The T03 cloud sends the pressures as named fields — `leftFrontTirePressure` and so on — and the
adapter files them under numeric ids for the one parser both models share. The id↔name table was
copied from the library documentation, whose labels the parser's own comment calls wrong: checked
on two real B10s (#32), the ids run FL=2646, FR=2653, RL=2660, RR=2667, not the
documented LF=2667 / LR=2646. The adapter kept the documented pairing, so three of a T03's
pressures turned one wheel round: the left front was filed under the id the parser reads as REAR
RIGHT, the left rear under front left, the right rear under rear left — on the Vehicle page, in
Home Assistant, and now in the ABRP frame. Only the right front survived. The alarm flags
(`...TirePressureState`) were already filed under the ids every public client agrees on and are
left alone. leapmotor-ha pairs a T03's named tyre fields with the same ids as this change.

The pressures below are made-up round numbers.
