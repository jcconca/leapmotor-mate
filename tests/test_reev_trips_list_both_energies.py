"""REEV — the trips LIST shows both energies, not one (@michapr, beta #11: "only one will be shown").

A trip where the range-extender ran has its electric efficiency blanked on purpose (finalize_trip:
once the generator refills the pack underneath, a SoC drop stops measuring anything). So the ⚡ pill
in the row has nothing to print and only the ⛽ line survives — while the car plainly also used
electricity, and the detail page has been showing exactly that figure all along.

get_trips now makes the same _reev_trip_elec call the detail page makes. It reads `ec_kwh`, a stored
column filled by the EC enrichment, so this costs a dict lookup rather than a cloud call.

⚠️ It read `ec_kwh` — the MOTOR's share — until 05/08/26, when Silvio settled it: *«la quota
guida non dovremmo mai prenderla in considerazione, sempre l'energia totale, quello che facciamo
anche per le EV»*. The share was also not the figure the money is billed on — `reev_trip_electric_cost`
draws the paid stock down by `ec_kwh` — so a card showed "1.7 kWh" over a cost worked out on 2.0
(@michapr, beta #11). These tests kept passing throughout: they name the column, and the column was
the thing that was wrong.
