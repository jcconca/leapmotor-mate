"""One drive, two pages, two answers — the trip detail printed a dash for a figure the trips list
was already printing (@michapr, beta #27, 07/08/26).

He asked why a generator trip records no average consumption. The first answer measured his OTHER
idea — dividing by the electric-only kilometres — and rejected it with his own numbers, correctly:
two of three such trips landed below the minimum of his real electric ones. But that was not what he
was asking for. His arithmetic divides by the WHOLE distance and shows the two energies as a PAIR:

    1.2 kWh over 68 km  →  1.8 kWh/100km        (the electric half)
    4.6 L   over 68 km  →  6.8 L/100km          (the other half)

*"I think the 1.2 kWh are right. Because all other energy is coming from generator — counted by fuel
usage."* And he is right that it is not a missing measurement: it is the electric part of what the
drive cost, and the litres beside it are the rest.

🔴 The part worth not repeating: Mate had been computing exactly that number all along and printing
it on the trips list (`partials/trip_row.html`), while this page dashed for the same trip.
`get_trip_detail` has called `_reev_trip_elec` since Phase D and the template simply never used the
result — so the disagreement was between two of our own templates, not between us and him.

⚠️ It stays OUT of the AVG CONSUMPTION tile. getEC counts roughly what LEFT THE BATTERY, and the
generator drives the wheels without passing through the pack, so 1.8 here and 13.1 on a pure
electric trip are different quantities. Printed under one label they would invite the comparison —
so it is marked instead (blue, ⚡, beside the litres), which is his own suggestion: *"in brackets or
in other color to show that it is a calculated value only"*.

📍 18/09/2026 (beta D #31): the card is boxes now — ⚡ and ⛽ side by side — and there is no labelled
AVG CONSUMPTION tile any more: the ⚡ box prints one consumption line. The rule is unchanged: the
ordinary line reads only `efficiency_kwh_100km`, and this rate is its own line, blue and marked,
on the beta build only.
