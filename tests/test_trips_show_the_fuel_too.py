"""The petrol half, where a range-extender's driving is summed up (@michapr, BetaTester #11).

He had the litres on each individual trip and nothing at all where those trips are added together:
*"missing the data still here: at the top of calendar and at the top of the trips"* — twice, a day
apart. The Charges page had grown its delivered/battery pair; Trips still answered in kilowatt-hours
alone, on a car that also burns petrol.

Both surfaces are fed from a place that already exists, deliberately:

  · the month strip, the day drawer header and `trips_totals` all fold trips through the same three
    helpers, so the fuel is added once and appears in all three;
  · the page hero reads `reev_fuel_summary()`, the one function that totals litres — a second sum
    here would be the third copy of a rule that has already cost one release.
