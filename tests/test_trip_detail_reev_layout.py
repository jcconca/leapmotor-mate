"""On a range-extender the trip's fuel sits in the header, and the block below stops repeating it.

@michapr, beta #27, 06/08/26 — he opens by saying the beta's defects are behind us and it is time
for the presentation: *«Since REEV users expect to consume gasoline, this specific notice (or
warning) isn't strictly necessary; we could integrate the data into the existing upper field.»*

Looking at the rendered page made his point sharper than his words. The header already showed
**12.4** as AVG CONSUMPTION and **12.4 kWh** as ENERGY USED — and the amber "Dual energy" box
directly underneath opened with **12.4 kWh** again. The same number three times in one column, the
third framed as a warning; what the box actually added was the fuel.

So: the litres move up beside the kWh (which is what a plain electric car already does), the
electric figure stops being repeated below, and the box loses the amber border and the title — it
was never a warning, it is the detail.

🔑 **Nothing is dropped.** Four things live only in that block and have nowhere else to go: the SoC
and tank start→end, the split between kWh paid at the plug and kWh the generator supplied, the
kilometres the generator drove, and the note explaining why the electric figure is right for the
cost and wrong for the consumption. The test below holds each of them.

    The tile was 130px and "⛽ 4.6 L · 6.8 L/100km" needs 140 at 13px, so it wrapped — and it wrapped
    INSIDE the second figure, leaving `L/100km` alone on the next line under a bare `6.8`. The same
    orphaned-unit look as #199, on the line beta #27 had just asked for.

    Measured in the browser: shrinking the type is not a fix — a realistic big trip
    ("⛽ 12.4 L · 15.7 L/100km") still needs 132px at 11px. The halves are 51 and 86px on their own,
    so each is made unbreakable and the wrap falls BETWEEN them: two whole figures, always.

    📍 The two figures now sit in the FUEL section (beta #31, three areas) instead of stacked under
    the kWh, which is why this reads the section rather than the old tile. The section is full width
    so neither wraps at 375px today — but the guard stays: a longer language will want the wrap to
    fall between the figures, not inside one.
