"""Filling the tank DURING a drive must not erase that drive's petrol (beta #30, @pdifeo).

His bundle, swept trip by trip: on **3 of 98** the fuel level goes UP between start and end — he
stopped for petrol in the middle. On all three Mate recorded `engine_ran = False` and no litres at
all, so the drive reads as fully electric:

    30/07 04:08   32 km   fuel 73.4% → 99.7%   generator=No   litres=—   SoC 69.8 → 73.3
    03/08 03:30   36 km   fuel 80.6% → 100.0%  generator=No   litres=—   SoC 65.0 → 46.7
    25/07 05:06    6 km   fuel 36.2% → 83.7%   generator=No   litres=—   SoC 76.0 → 73.9

The first one is provably wrong. His own note for that day: *"fatto parzialmente con carburante per
un tratto iniziale (che è in salita)"* — and the battery **gains 3.5 points over 32 km of climbing**,
which is the generator's signature and nothing else's.

The mechanism is arithmetic: litres = start − end, which goes NEGATIVE on a refuel and falls into
the "nothing burned" branch. There is no independent "engine on" signal to fall back on — the
function's own docstring says the range-extender ran iff the level dropped.

So the honest answer is not zero, it is **unknown**: something was burned, we cannot say how much,
and the trip must not be counted as a zero in anyone's fuel total. → [[signal-absent-is-not-signal-zero]]
