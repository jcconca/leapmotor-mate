"""The home wallbox counter must keep being read while the CAR's cloud is dark (#295 @gm27271).

His C10 charged from 19:37 to 07:32. Mate opened the charge at 20:35, lost the Leapmotor cloud at
20:38, and got it back for nine minutes at 22:04. The meter is in his house and never went away —
but Mate only read it inside `state == CHARGING`, and a poll that raises never reaches that branch,
so for 86 minutes nobody looked at a counter sitting in the same room. Everything it did in the
dark arrived as ONE step, where a reset is indistinguishable from a rise and the #46 ceiling (22 kW
× hours × 1.5) is far too wide to object. The charge came out at 7.69 kWh AC against 10.03 kWh DC:
a 130.4 % "efficiency", which the wallbox page then printed in green.

The fix is where it belongs: the meter is read because a CHARGE IS OPEN, not because a remote cloud
answered this minute. The loop already keeps polling every 60 s through an outage — this rides on
that, and the charge survives the gap by design (see the resume comment in recorder.py).
