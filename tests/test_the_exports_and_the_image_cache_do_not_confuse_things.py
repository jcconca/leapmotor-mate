"""Two small ways data goes to the wrong place (30/08 audit).

CSV FORMULA INJECTION. Mate's exports write free-text columns straight out. A cell beginning
`=`, `+`, `-` or `@` is a FORMULA to Excel, LibreOffice and Sheets — so opening an export can run
what the text says. It is not only the owner's own notes: `location_name` comes from OpenStreetMap
and Open Charge Map, which anybody can edit, and an export is exactly what gets mailed to someone
else when a charge looks wrong.

The neutralisation is the standard one — prefix the cell with an apostrophe — applied ONLY to
strings, because a numeric column may legitimately start with a minus and must stay a number.

CAR-IMAGE CACHE. The parsed ~39-layer package is memoised under `len(package_bytes)`. Two cars
whose packages happen to weigh the same byte count share the entry, and the second is served the
first one's picture. The length is a cheap proxy for identity that is not one.

The image-cache half runs anywhere; the CSV half reads `_csv_safe` out of `main`, which needs
fastapi — absent from the minimal CI environment, so those skip there rather than fail.
