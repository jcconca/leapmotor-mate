""""Last seen" must mean when the CAR reported, not when we wrote the row — #232.

The poller writes a position row every 30 s while parked, and it keeps writing them while the cloud
re-serves one frozen frame (only DRIVING skips repeats). So the row is always seconds old, whatever
the data in it. Both places that print "last seen" used that row time:

    Overview map popup     "C10 — 22 seconds ago"     over a marker sixteen hours stale
    Status card            "22 seconds ago"           with an amber note only while moving

@rop12770 was looking at exactly that popup in #232 while asking why his car was in the sea.

🔑 The true age was already computed and already tested — `data_age_s`, from the frame's own
timestamp, measured on every poll even when nothing is announced (test_data_age.py pins that). It
simply never reached the page. Nothing new is calculated here; a figure that was wrong now shows the
number Mate already had.

⚠️ The amber stays a MARK on that one figure, not a second number beside it: the case worth
flagging is still "the link died while the car was moving" (#178), and two correct numbers under
one label read as a defect even when both are right.
