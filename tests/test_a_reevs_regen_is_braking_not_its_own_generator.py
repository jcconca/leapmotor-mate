"""On a range-extender, energy flowing into the pack is not proof of braking.

The recorder counts regen as "unplugged, and the pack current is clearly negative". On a BEV that is
exactly right. On a range-extender the generator refills the pack **while driving, unplugged**, with
the same sign — so petrol burned to make electricity is recorded as recovered braking energy.

Measured on @ebagnoli's raw signal log, on the one drive of his month where the generator ran
(19/09/2026, 77 km, 4.9 L). Splitting the intervals by whether the car's millilitre counter (3263)
moved, under the recorder's own current gate:

    generator running              3.761 kWh   89.0%   over 72 intervals
    generator off (real braking)   0.465 kWh   11.0%   over 14 intervals

Across the 50 drives in his signal window the generator share is 6.4% — because it ran on exactly
ONE of them. That is the shape of this defect: not a small error spread over every trip, but a
figure that is *right* on a pure-electric drive and almost entirely wrong on a generator drive.

🔑 The discriminator is the fuel counter itself, and it is on the same poll: signal 3263 counts
MILLILITRES, and a generator burns tens of them between two polls. Fuel fell since the last reading
→ the generator was running over that interval and the current cannot be attributed to braking.
Fuel flat → nothing was burned, so whatever went into the pack came from the wheels.

The result is a LOWER BOUND, deliberately: braking while the generator runs is real regen and is
dropped with it, because the pack current carries no way to split the two. A number that is only
ever too small is one an owner can act on; a number silently inflated by petrol is not.

⚠️ One owner, one generator drive. The 89% is what we can measure, not a constant.
