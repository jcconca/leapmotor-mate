"""The operation PIN belongs to the CAR, not to the install (multi-car, #186).

@cookingeek found this in an afternoon, reading the design — before his second car had even arrived:

    "For performing actions on the car, I'd think you'd need to store two PINs. The T03 has a
     4-digit one, the C10 probably doesn't — or rather, I don't really know."

He is right, and it was a hole in eight steps of multi-car work: battery capacity, the REEV flag,
abilities, model, MQTT entities all became facts about a car — the PIN stayed one secret for the
whole install. With two cars whose PINs differ, every command to the second one would have failed,
and only the commands: reads never carry a PIN, so the interface would have looked perfectly healthy.

🔑 The cloud checks it PER VIN — `/operPwd/verify` takes `operatePassword` **and** `vin`. That does
not prove two cars must differ, but it proves the API is built so they can.

⚠️ Fallback is the whole safety of it: no per-car PIN stored → the install-wide one, which is what
every existing install has. One car, or two cars sharing a PIN, must see no change whatsoever.
