"""An absent value published as "" makes Home Assistant complain, not shrug (30/08 audit).

`pub()` writes an empty string when a value is None, and Home Assistant reads that as a state — so
a numeric entity (`device_class: power`, `unit: W`) receiving "" logs a conversion error on every
poll where the car does not report the signal. Two sensors already carry the antidote in their
discovery payload, `{{ value if value else none }}`, which turns the empty string into a genuine
unknown. `climate_power` and `fan_level` did not, and they are precisely the two signals a car
stops reporting the moment the climate is off.

Not fixed at `pub()`: an empty retained payload is also how a topic is cleared, and the two sensors
that already had the template show the intended shape. The fix belongs in the discovery config.

→ signal-absent-is-not-signal-zero: absent is not zero, and it is not "" either.

CI-safe: reads the bridge source, no broker.
