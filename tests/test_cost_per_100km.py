"""What 100 km have COST — every euro spent, over every kilometre driven (db_reader).

The range-extender version was written as working code by @michapr on his own fork (30/07/26) and
never offered as a pull request. His priced the CONSUMPTION: efficiency × the rate paid per kWh. So
did the first version here, and Silvio cut it short on 05/08 — *«se deve essere un costo deve essere
totale non parziale»*. He is right about what that leaves out. Measured on his own history for #207,
only **71.8%** of a bill reaches the trips at all; the rest leaves the battery standing still, on
climate, preconditioning and the on-board charger's losses, and it was money he paid.

So this divides MONEY by KILOMETRES and nothing else. There is no €/kWh in it, which is why the
meter-versus-battery question — the subject of half the tests this file used to hold — simply
stopped existing: `cost` is what the charge was billed, and billed costs are added, not divided
into anything.

What is left to get wrong is the direction of the error. Anything Mate was not told — an untagged
charge, a refuel nobody entered — takes kilometres out of nothing and puts euros nowhere, so the
figure can only ever come out LOW. Every test below that touches missing data checks that it is
counted and named, never quietly completed.
