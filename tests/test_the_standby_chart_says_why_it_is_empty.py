"""A standby chart that has had nothing to draw must say so, instead of looking broken.

@riri19 (#241, 10/08/2026): *"the data seems to be stuck/frozen since 05/08"*. It was not stuck.
Mate had measured every stop since; each one had simply lost 0.1% — one step of the car's charge
sensor — and a drop that small cannot be told apart from noise, so no bar was drawn. Reading his
bundle answered it in a minute. Reading his screen could not, because the page says nothing at all
about the stops it discarded: he saw a chart that stopped growing, and from there it looks broken.

`get_vampire_drain` already returns `rejected` (each with hours, drop and why) and the battery route
already receives them — added in v3.10.2 for the bundle. Nothing printed them. This is the same
shape as the placeholder that never resolves: an absence rendered as nothing at all.

AND THE THRESHOLD WAS MISLABELLED. Two strings on that page, in all seven languages, call it a
`%/day` threshold. It is not a rate: `get_vampire_drain` compares the raw drop in SoC points
(`drop = soc0 - soc_end`) against it, so a 12-hour stop and a 3-day stop face the very same 0.2.
Calling it "per day" invites exactly the wrong fix — raising it to catch a slow drain. The bundle
carries the same wrong unit in two places, which is where WE read it during triage.

CI-safe apart from the route test, which skips without fastapi.
