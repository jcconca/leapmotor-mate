"""Every language must carry every string, on every surface that has strings.

This exists because nothing was checking. Two separate holes had been open for a while and neither
produced an error anywhere:

  * de.json was 80 strings short and pl.json 91, so German and Polish users read parts of the app
    in English — including a beta tester who sends us data in German every day.
  * The setup wizard keeps its OWN dictionary, separate from the locale files, and `acctWarn` was
    missing from the French and German copies. That string is the warning to use an account
    dedicated to Mate — the single most important sentence in the wizard and the cause of the most
    common support case there is. The wizard reads it with `s.acctWarn` and assigns it straight to
    textContent, and JavaScript turns an undefined into the literal text "undefined", so those two
    languages showed the word "undefined" where the warning belongs.

Both were invisible: a missing key isn't a crash, it's a gap. The only thing that finds a gap is
something that counts. Hence this file.

The wizard is parsed out of the template rather than imported, because it lives in JavaScript
inside HTML. Parsing is done by finding each language's opening line and reading to its closing
brace — the blocks contain no nested objects — instead of by one big regex, which quietly matched
different blocks depending on indentation while this was being written.
