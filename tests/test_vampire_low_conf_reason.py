"""Why a rest-drain estimate is uncertain — not merely that it is.

Reported as #160 by riri19: a park of 45.9 hours, properly closed by six trips the next day,
carried the label "uncertain estimate (short stop)". It was not short. The reliability test has
TWO independent halves:

    reliable = drop is at least 4 sensor steps   AND   the rate's error band is within ±1 %/day

and only the second is about duration. In riri19's case the second passed with a factor of ten to
spare (0.2 / 45.9 * 24 = 0.10 against a limit of 1.0); what failed was the first — a 0.2% drop is
two steps of a sensor that moves in 0.1% quanta, so drain cannot be told apart from rounding.

Calling that a short stop is not a wording nitpick: it points the user at the wrong explanation.
riri19 went looking for a fault in how the park was closed, because the label told him to.
