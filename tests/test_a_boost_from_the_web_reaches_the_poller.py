"""A boost asked for by the web is one the poller sees.

A command is followed by a minute of fast polling, so the car's answer reaches the page in seconds
rather than at the next 30 s poll; `/api/boost` (a "getting in the car" shortcut) asks for the same
thing for a few minutes. Both write a setting the poller reads. v3.10.0 moved the poller to one key
per car, `boost_until_<vin>` (a command to the car in the garage must not wake the one on the
motorway), and the web went on writing the old shared `boost_until`, which nothing reads any more.
From then on a command from the web never sped anything up, and the shortcut did nothing at all.

The command boosts the car it went to — the one selected in the interface, which is where
command_client sends it. The shortcut cannot know which car you got into, so it boosts every one,
as the single shared boost did before v3.10.0.
