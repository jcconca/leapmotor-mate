"""Ability-gated command buttons — issue #142 (chengler, T03).

The 'Unlock Charge Cable' button was shown on every model, but the T03 can't unlock the charge
cable: it never declares ability code 48 (UNLOCK_CHARGE_GUN), the official app hides the option,
and the button no-ops on the car. Mate already had a capability system (command_shown) — the button
just wasn't wired to it.

The fix gates command buttons on the car's OWN declared abilities (the VehicleAbility set it reports,
the ground truth for what THIS model supports), via a whitelist COMMAND_ABILITY. This is model-blind:
any car that doesn't declare the code hides the button, present and future models alike.

Pinned here, on real declared-ability sets from diagnostics bundles:
- T03 (chengler, #142): [...] no 48  → hidden
- B10 (Wartopia, #128):  [...] has 48 → shown
And the crucial NON-regression: climate stays OUT of ability gating. The T03 omits AC_ON (code 6)
yet cools (#67), so gating A/C on the ability would wrongly hide it — command_shown must not.
