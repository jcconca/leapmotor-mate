"""The monthly report stops being electric-only on a range-extender (Silvio's call, beta #11/#22).

Until now the report had exactly one REEV branch — it HID the regen tile — and added nothing. An
owner who spent half the month on the generator got a report about the other half, with no litres,
no L/100 km and no fuel spend anywhere.

Two questions, kept apart on purpose:
  • litres BURNED — from the trips, over the generator-on distance
  • litres and € BOUGHT — from the refuels the owner typed in, their own table and their own pass

A tank is filled on one day and burned over the following fortnight, so a month can hold a refuel
and no engine-on driving, or engine-on driving and no refuel. Adding the two would answer neither.
