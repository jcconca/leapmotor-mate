"""Three things @michapr built into his own copy of the trip card, taken into ours — beta #31.

He attached a working `trip_detail.html` on 13/09/26 and asked what we thought of it. Most of what
it does is the electric-vs-generator split, which is measured and cannot be shown honestly. Three of
its ideas introduce NO new number and are simply better, so they come across:

  1. the trip's running cost per distance, next to the total it is derived from;
  2. the secondary readings folded into a native disclosure instead of always-open rows.

His third — the electricity and the fuel as two COLUMNS instead of two stacked blocks — was built,
measured on the rendered page and reverted on 13/09: this page is `lg:grid-cols-3` and the card sits
in the first column, and with our 13–24px figures and a second split inside area 3 it did not fit
(**87px per column at a 1024px viewport, 148px at 1600px**, ~70px for "5.4 L/100km").
📍 It was TAKEN on 18/09/2026 in his own compact form (beta D #31, approved by Silvio), after
measuring again on the rendered page: 73px per box at a 1024px window, enough for his 10–16px type
with one figure per line — see test_the_trip_summary_is_in_boxes_for_every_car. The last test below
still holds the part that stands: no viewport breakpoint around the pair.

Rendered, not grepped: a source-level check would pass on a template that prints
``{'name': 'Euro'…}`` or resolves ``cost100_val`` to nothing.
