"""The poll loop, actually executed — which nothing in this suite had ever done.

Every other poller test reaches a helper. The 200-line loop inside `main()` — the thing that
records every trip and every charge of every install — was covered by nobody, so the refactor that
moves one car's state into a `VehicleContext` could have broken it with all 2321 tests green. That
is not a hypothetical: a green suite is exactly what made the last two defects invisible.

So the loop runs here against a stubbed cloud: a client that hands back canned frames and a real
database underneath. What it proves is small and load-bearing — the loop polls, the recorder
writes, and the per-car state (error counters, GPS signs, the raw-signal deltas) lives on the
context rather than in the enclosing function.
