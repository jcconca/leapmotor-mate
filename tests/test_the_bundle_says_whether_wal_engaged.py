"""A bundle must say which journal mode the database is really in.

`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` does not fail when it cannot be honoured — it falls back and reports the
mode it settled on, and we threw that answer away (`poller/db.py`, the result of the execute was
never read). Nothing logged it, and no bundle carried it, so the one fact that separates two
opposite diagnoses was unavailable on every installation.

Why it separates them: in WAL, readers do not block writers. Outside WAL they do. #338 (@dommi1966,
A10 on standalone Docker on a QNAP NAS, 28/09/2026) shows 1013 `database is locked` messages and 747
frames lost in four hours, the poller log ending mid-stream and the heartbeat three hours stale while
the web process still answered. If WAL is engaged there, the contention is writer-against-writer; if
it silently fell back — which is what a filesystem without proper shared-memory support does, and a
NAS share is exactly that — then a long-lived per-thread read connection can starve the writer, and
that is ours. The same day, #298 (@arzthilfe, add-on) showed the same error eight times.

We cannot ask them to run anything: a bundle is what a non-technical owner can produce, and it must
carry the answer by itself. So the mode is read from the database and printed, and it is printed as
a WARNING when it is not `wal`, because a reader who sees "delete" must not have to know what that
implies.
