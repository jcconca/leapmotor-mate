"""A new import here can kill MateDesktop on somebody's Mac. This is where that gets caught.

MateDesktop is a shell plus a payload. The shell carries Python and the libraries and is signed and
released rarely; the payload is `web/` and `poller/` — this code — and it flows to every installed
copy on **every Mate tag**. So the shell stays frozen at what it was built with while the code
running inside it moves on.

Which means an import added here can land on a shell that has no such module, and the app dies at
startup. MateDesktop's updater does guard against that, but it reads the payload's
`requirements.txt`: it catches a new *package* and is blind to a new *module of the standard
library*, which appears in no requirements file. And the shell does not carry the whole stdlib —
`statistics`, for one, is not in PyInstaller's `base_library.zip`; it is in the app only because the
build happened to see it used.

`mate_desktop/payload_deps.py` is the contract that makes the build see it. This test compares that
contract against what this repository actually imports, so the mismatch shows up **before a tag**
rather than on a user's machine.

Real case: Mate 3.4.10 started importing PIL directly (`car_image.py`, measuring which way the
charging animation runs) and the contract never learned. It worked anyway — Pillow arrives as an
extra of `leapmotor-api[image]` — which is precisely the kind of luck that runs out quietly.

Needs the MateDesktop checkout next door; CI has neither, so it skips there. That is not the usual
"skipped where it matters" trap: this check can only exist where both repositories do, and that is
the machine where releases are cut.
