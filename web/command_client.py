# A/C full-OFF is MODEL-SPECIFIC — the B10 and T03 want OPPOSITE payloads:
#  • B10/C10: ac_switch with operate=off — drives acSwitch signal 1938→0, confirmed on-car
#    2026-06-06. The B10 IGNORES operate=close (tested live: it applies the setpoint and stays on),
#    so ac_switch operate=off is its only real full-off. Left exactly as-is.
#  • T03: operate=off inside the FULL seven-field body. Solved and verified on-car by **@derekzoli**
#    (06-07/08/2026, markoceri/leapmotor-api#9 — the report we opened): *"on the T03 it's not the
#    value of operate that matters, it's the shape of the payload: it needs off, but only with the
#    other fields present"*. He confirmed it the only way that counts — re-reading the vehicle status
#    ~8 s later and watching acSwitch go false with the A/C actually stopping, not an ACK: the cloud
#    answers code:0 to every one of these, which is why nobody could tell them apart from a log.
#    He measured the two near-misses too: `operate=close` in the same full body (what
#    REMOTE_CTL_AC_OFF / api.ac_off sends, i.e. what Mate used to send here) and bare
#    `{"operate":"off"}` (the B10's form) are both accepted and ignored. This closes a defect open
#    across the whole ecosystem — kerniger/leapmotor-ha#28, markoceri/leapmotor-api#9 — and our own
#    seven candidates (the retired web/t03_offtest.py) all missed it: we varied mode, fan, recirc and
#    invented keys while holding operate at close/manual. He held the body still and moved operate.
#  • B05: stays on the B10/C10 path (no data either way — don't change what we can't verify).
#
# ⚠️ poller/main.py sends this same body for the Home Assistant button. The two literals are held
# character-for-character identical by a test, because the page and HA must not come to disagree
# about the same car in silence.
