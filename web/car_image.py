"""Live Overview car image.

Composes the per-vehicle car-picture *layer package* to reflect the current state (charge cable,
charging animation, trunk) instead of serving a single static render — mirrors the official app.
The model + colour are baked into the downloaded package, so this works for any car. Falls back to
the package's static image on any problem, so the Overview never breaks.

Reflects the charge cable (+ charging animation), the tailgate, all 4 doors, and the 2 left-side
windows (the only ones drawn in the 3/4 view) — driven by the body state in `positions`. The right
windows and the front hood have no layer/signal, so they're never shown (same as the official app).

The charging animation is built here rather than by the library's `compose_animated`, for two
reasons found on the real packages (#211):

* **Which frames.** The library plays a hardcoded `carpic_charge2..15`. The B10's package ships
  **18** of them, so the last three — the ones where the pulse reaches the car — were never drawn:
  the pulse died halfway down the cable and restarted at the wallbox. We play every frame the
  package actually contains.
* **Which direction.** @banolka reports the T03 drawing the flow *out of* the car, in the official
  app as well as here — the frames come from the cloud, both apps just play them in file order. The
  order is ours to choose, so we **measure** it instead of keeping a per-model table by hand: a
  hardcoded "reverse it for the T03" would silently break the day Leapmotor fixes the artwork.
