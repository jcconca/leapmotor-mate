    Proving it took half an hour over 30 000 log lines, and the question that decides which fix is
    right — what the CABLE signal said during those hours — could not be answered at all: the bundle
    carries the raw signals as one snapshot, taken ten hours after the cable came out.

    and retroactive: it answers on data already collected, without waiting for a recurrence.

        frames 202/202 distinct → the car was ONLINE and the cloud never raised the flag
        frames   1/477 distinct → the car was OFFLINE and the cloud repeated its last frame

    the reconstructor already covers; the first is the one nothing covers.
