"""Public EV charging stations from OpenStreetMap (Overpass API).

Two consumers:
  - 📍 charge labels: a background sweep names the public charging station of each
    closed charge (shown on the Charges list and the Overview "last charge" card).
    Opt-in via the `charger_locator` setting — home charges are never looked up, and
    history backfills too (charges already store their GPS position since v1.0).
  - Navigation page: "Find charging stations" around the car, user-picked radius.

Keyless and free (no API key), same etiquette as geocode.py: proper User-Agent,
tiny volume, ~1 s spacing inside the sweep. OSM is a community map database — names
live in the name/operator/brand tags (often only `operator`) and there is NO live
free/busy state. Standard library only (urllib) — no new dependency.

Idea credit: @hubcasale (PR #48). Reimplemented web-side: the poller stays untouched
(no shared-connection threads) and old charges get their label retroactively.

    Distance decides first: the nearest PHYSICAL SITE wins outright — a different,

# from PUN alone never had one, PUN has no per-station page) — this is a one-time,
# user-triggered pass (Settings button), not part of the ongoing sweep/TTL. It NEVER
# touches location_name: only a name that still matches what's already saved gets a
# link attached, so a charge the user picked by hand from an ambiguity popup — or
# whose surroundings changed since — is never silently relabelled.

# One Overpass call per charge, a second apart. 200 in a row is 200 requests from one IP in
# three minutes, against the 40-per-half-hour the ongoing sweep holds itself to — enough to earn
# a temporary block on a free, shared, donation-run service, and the user would experience that
# as Mate having stopped resolving names. 50 per click instead: the button is repeatable and
# says how many are left, so a long backlog is a few clicks rather than one rude burst.
