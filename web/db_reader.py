# What stood here before was a tolerance: ignore the flag when the SoC is more than 15 points below
# the charge limit. That was fitted to the first report — the flag seen at 23 % with the limit at
# 90 % — and it did hide the lie at the start of every charge, which is why this looked like a rare

# of fix for a signal read backwards.

# bundle, instead of a completion it cannot establish. Deriving a real "finished" is the next step

# charge also sits at flag 0, so the inverse reading alone would announce a completion for a charge
# that never happened.
#
# BEVs are untouched. There is no BEV bundle carrying 3736, the flag may well be honest there, and

    v2.14.1. ⚠️ Second time this file has made this mistake — `_reev_trip_fuel` had its noise floor
    on the percentage while reading the millilitres (beta #22/#23).

    ⛔ One column for the whole walk, never a mix: half the kilometres counted on a 47.5 mL grid and
    half on a 1 mL one is a total that means nothing.

    ⛔ **The rule that looks better and is not.** "Anchor on the last fuel CHANGE and credit every
    kilometre since" scores −2 % if you reconstruct the trail from the raw signal log — and +54 % on
    the real one, because it hands the generator the whole electric middle of a drive that burned a
    little at each end. The raw log records a signal only WHEN IT CHANGES, so rebuilding from it
    gives a timeline 3× sparser than `positions`, which gets a row every poll (~11 s while driving).
    Any rule tuned on that reconstruction is tuned on an artefact. Model the poll grid, not the
    signal log.

    ⛔ And there is **no "generator running" signal** in the cloud. 1277 looks exactly like one — 0
    across a pure-electric drive, 1 across a petrol one — and across all 13 days of the bundle it
    turns out to fire in one-minute bursts at the start and end of drives, with 0.001 L burned
    inside them against 24.9 L outside."""

    a fortune, and no guard here can tell the two apart.

    13:54 after a move from Europe/Rome to America/New_York.

# A tank can only rise one way: somebody put fuel in it. Nothing recuperates into it, nothing
# refills it while driving — so a rise in the car's OWN gauge *is* a refuel, and the only thing left
# to reject is the gauge's noise. That gives one rule and one guard:
#   • the level rises by at least _FUEL_DETECT_MIN_RISE_PCT between two consecutive readings, and
#   • it has not fallen back on the reading after that — a single high sample is a spike, not a fill.
# Deliberately NOTHING about gear or speed. A car can fall asleep at the pump and only report the
# new level when it wakes for the next drive, so demanding "parked in both frames" would lose
# exactly the refuels most worth catching.
#
# What we can and cannot know is the whole reason a detection is not a refuel until the user says so:
#   WHEN   an interval — after the last reading at the old level, by the first at the new one
#   LITRES an estimate — Δ% of a 50 L tank; the gauge is a float, not a flow meter
#   PRICE  never. The cloud has no idea what you paid, so that field is the user's and only his.

                                  # is thirty times the measured settle — and still nowhere near

# Sardinia, which is what the Overview map shows. Everything east of Greenwich was unaffected,
# which is why it survived this long.

    Mate's efficiency figure deliberately goes blank on a trip where the range-extender ran: a
    SoC drop stops measuring how efficiently the battery drove you once the generator has been
    refilling the pack underneath. That is right for the question "how efficient was this", and
    it leaves the other question — "what did this cost me" — unanswered on exactly the long
    trips that cost the most. Two REEV owners arrived at that hole independently, from different
    cars, in the same week (@michapr, who proposed this, and @gm27271).

    Cost does not care where the electrons came from. Fuel burned is fuel you bought; the NET
    drop in the battery is grid energy you bought. Whatever the generator moved from the tank
    into the pack is already counted once, in the litres — so subtracting it from the battery
    side is not losing it, it is refusing to bill it twice. No trip is excluded.

    Verified against physics rather than argued: on one 541 km range-extender day in @gm27271's
    signal bundle, this SoC-based figure came to 11.5 kWh while integrating the pack's own volts
    × amps over the same day gave 11.7 — two independent methods, 2% apart. (The same bundle also

    @ebagnoli's question (beta #13): *«dovrebbe apparire da qualche parte il costo al KWh in Euro
    dell'elettricità alla colonnina affinché la ricarica elettrica risulti conveniente rispetto alla
    benzina»*. He charges at home off solar surplus, so his own answer is "always" — the number he
    wants is for standing in front of a public column with a tank in the car.

        break-even €/kWh = (€/L × L/100km WITH THE GENERATOR) ÷ (kWh/100km DRIVING ELECTRIC)

    🔴 The two rates are each measured on their OWN kilometres, and that is the whole difficulty.
    `reev_total_consumption` already publishes a kWh/100km and an L/100km — both divided by the
    WHOLE distance, which is exactly right for "what did the driving cost me" and exactly wrong
    here. Reusing them would drag the petrol rate down by every electric kilometre and answer a
    question nobody asked, under numbers that look like the right ones.
    → [[feedback-two-numbers-one-word]]

    The electric side comes from trips the generator sat out: on a generator trip the pack is being
    refilled underneath, so `ec_kwh` there is not a description of electric driving
    → [[reev-getec-is-battery-not-traction]]. The petrol side is `reev_fuel_summary`'s engine-on
    figure, already measured over the distance the generator actually drove (@michapr, beta #26).
    The price is the blend of HIS OWN refuels — never a pump price we made up.

    Returns None rather than a guess when a half is missing: no generator kilometres, no refuel, no
    electric trips. And when a side rests on less than `_BREAKEVEN_THIN_KM`, the answer still comes
    but carries `thin` — on @ebagnoli's own history the petrol half is **46 km, one trip**, and a
    bare number would hide that. → [[feedback-verified-vs-inferred]]

    reev_total_consumption above works out both sides from percentages: the pack's SoC drop
    against a nominal capacity, the tank's level against a nominal 50 litres. That is the right
    tool where nothing better exists — it needs no prices, no typing, and it works trip by trip.
    But on a lifetime total nothing better is not the situation Mate is in: every charge it
    recorded already carries its energy AND its cost, and every refuel the owner entered already
    carries litres off a receipt. Measured beats derived, and it beats it in three separate ways.

    It reads the AC side. _billed_kwh returns the wallbox's own kWh for a home charge, which is
    what the meter charged you; the SoC-derived figure is the DC energy that reached the battery,
    smaller by the 10-15% lost in conversion (see the answer to #134 — the gap is physics, not a
    bug). A cost card built on the DC side understates the bill, always in the same direction.

    It needs no assumption about the car. No nominal pack capacity, so battery ageing cannot
    skew it; no linear fuel float, so a tank that reads optimistically near the bottom cannot.

    It sees what never became a trip. Vampire drain, preconditioning, cabin heating on the
    driveway: electricity bought and paid for that appears in no trip's SoC delta.

    What it cannot do is the other's job. It measures PURCHASES over a period, not consumption
    over those kilometres — charge the car tonight and drive it next week and the two land in

    The rule this whole function exists to enforce, in one line:

        🔑 **the numerator and the denominator must come out of the same stretch of time.**

    Before it, they did not. The euros were summed over the entire archive while the kilometres
    came from the recorded trips alone, so @nico89612 — who typed in 152 charges from before he
    installed Mate — read **4838.43 €/100 km**: months of spending over the 46 km of a single
    afternoon. Nothing about that number was a rounding error; the two halves described different
    years. The same card's OTHER half, the kWh/100 km, was already windowed correctly, which is how
    the split was found: his 19.2 kWh/100 km reproduces to the decimal.

    Two bases, and the one that prices MORE of what he actually spent wins:

    · **trips** — Mate's own reconstructed distance, with the euros starting where the kilometres
      start. A charge that ended before the first recorded trip has no kilometres to be divided by
      and contributes nothing. The RIGHT edge is deliberately left open: a charge made after the
      last trip will get its kilometres tomorrow, and excluding it would make the figure jitter
      day to day for everyone — the same "a full tank raises it until you drive it" property
      Silvio already accepted on the petrol side.

    · **odometer** — the car's own counter, between the first and the last charge carrying one
      (`charges.odometer_km`, stamped by the poller, typed on a manual charge, back-filled once
      from `positions`). Brim-to-brim, exactly as a driver measures fuel: the euros of every charge
      from the first stamped one up to — but NOT including — the last, because the energy of the
      closing charge is still in the battery. Measured on a real B10 the two agree: 6.19 against
      6.20 €/100 km. It is not a redefinition, it is the same answer from the car's own numbers.

    Why "prices more of the spending" rather than a coverage threshold: a threshold is a number
    somebody invented, and every install would sit near it differently. This comparison is a fact
    about the data — and it makes the change INERT for anyone with an ordinary history. On Silvio's
    B10 the trips price 119.74 € of 119.74 and the odometer 104.27, so the trips win and the card
    does not move at all. It only flips for the person the trips cannot speak for: someone whose
    charges reach back further than Mate's kilometres do, which is exactly #237.

    ⚠️ Declared simplification: on a range-extender the odometer basis is not offered. The petrol
    half of this card is measured per TRIP (litres burned × the blended €/L), so re-basing the
    electricity on the odometer would put the two halves back on two windows — the very defect
    being fixed. `allow_odometer` carries that.

    The range-extender version of this card was written by @michapr on his own fork (30/07/26) and
    never offered as a pull request. His priced the CONSUMPTION — efficiency × the rate paid per
    kWh — and so did the first version here. Silvio's call, 05/08/26, in one sentence: *«se deve
    essere un costo deve essere totale non parziale»*, and he is right about what that first version
    left out. Measured on his own history for #207, only **71.8%** of a bill lands on trips at all.
    The rest leaves the battery standing still — climate, preconditioning, the on-board charger's
    own losses — and it was money he paid. A card headed "cost" that quietly answers "cost of the
    driving" is a partial figure wearing a total's name.

    So nothing is multiplied by a rate here, and that makes the whole meter-versus-battery argument
    disappear: there is no divisor left to choose. `cost` is what the charge was BILLED — wallbox
    meter included, exactly as `compute_cost` wrote it — and the euros are added, not divided into
    anything. It is also why no €/kWh appears on this card: none is computed.

    ⚠️ Which way it can be wrong, and it is always the SAME way — LOW:

      · a charge with no price contributes kilometres to the divisor and nothing to the numerator;
      · a refuel the owner never entered does the same.

    Both are counted and said out loud, because a floor that admits it is a floor is honest and a
    floor presented as a total is the defect this card exists to avoid. Never silently completed

def _energy_balance_kwh(db, km: float, basis: dict) -> tuple:
    """How many kWh those `km` took, as a closed-system BALANCE — never trip by trip.

    @michapr, BetaTester #25, 06/08/26, worked out on his own history and cross-checked two ways.
    His own reason for not taking the obvious road, which is also Silvio's rule for this card:

        «`reev_total_consumption()`'s `kwh_100km` looks like the obvious answer, but it's trip-only
        by construction […] it would still miss every kWh that left the pack outside of a trip.»

    Measured for #207, only 71.8% of a bill lands on a trip at all. So the window is treated as one
    system and nothing is attributed to a journey:

        consumed = (energy charged INSIDE the window) − (net change in stored energy across it)

    🔑 **The same formula is right on both cars, and that is not a coincidence.** Energy enters the
    pack from the grid and — on a range-extender — from the generator:

        Δstored = charged + generator − consumed   →   consumed = charged + generator − Δstored

    so `charged − Δstored` is what left the pack MINUS the generator's share: the grid-derived half
    alone. On a card that prices fuel separately that is precisely the number wanted — the same
    refusal to bill the tank twice that `reev_total_consumption` documents. On a BEV `generator` is
    zero and it degenerates to plain consumption. No `is_reev` branch exists here, and none is
    needed.

    The window is the one this card sums kilometres over — handed in by `_km_basis`, so the cost
    and the kWh can never again describe two different stretches of time (#237). On the trip basis
    that is the first trip's `started_at` to the last trip's `ended_at`, exactly as before; on the
    odometer basis it is the first stamped charge to the last. A charge counts only if its OWN
    window sits entirely inside — one that ends before the start, or starts after the end, has
    already been absorbed into the SoC at that boundary, and counting it would bill it twice.
    (@michapr's July 9 session, ending 17:33 before a first trip on the 10th, is exactly that case.)

    ⚠️ The estimate enters only through the SMALL term. `Δstored` is SoC × NOMINAL capacity, and an
    LFP's SoC is counted rather than measured — drift ±15%. On his window that term is 3.80 kWh
    against 63.89 charged, 6%, so even a 15% error there moves the answer under 1%. A window that
    ends much fuller or emptier than it started leans on it harder, and there is no way around that
    from the cloud.

    Returns `(kwh_100km, counted, missing)`. `kwh_100km` is None — not 0.0 — whenever the balance
    cannot be trusted: nothing charged inside the window, no SoC at a boundary, or a balance that
    comes out at or below zero. A car that drove 200 km did not use 0 kWh; printing that would be
    a wrong number wearing the confidence of a measurement.

    start_soc, end_soc, cost, ac_energy_kwh, location_type, energy_added_kwh.

    Model: the battery is ONE reservoir at a blended price; only a charge moves the price,
    consumption never does → replay the charges, anchoring the mix on each charge's SoC. Capacity
    CANCELS out (SoC ratios), so this is capacity-free and robust to SoH error. Update per charge:

        p' = (start_soc·p + (end_soc − start_soc)·rate) / end_soc

    where rate = the FULL cost paid ÷ the energy that actually REACHED THE BATTERY
    (`energy_added_kwh`). Bootstrap: the first priced charge sets p to its own rate (the pre-existing
    energy is valued at the first thing we can measure). Unconfirmed charges (cost=NULL) are simply
    ABSENT from this list → carry-forward, i.e. the blend is unchanged across them — Mate's framework
    rule "no cost until confirmed, HOME excluded".

    ⚠️ A charge that cost ZERO is NOT one of those. `cost=0.0` is only ever written deliberately —
    the #120 free mark (own solar), the FREE type, a band priced at 0, a manual 0 — while an unknown
    price is `cost=NULL` (`compute_cost` returns None, never 0, when no tariff applies). The guard
    here used to drop `rate <= 0`, so free energy really sitting in the pack left the blend at the
    last PAID rate: @oenukr charged from his roof and Mate billed his trips more than he had ever
    spent (#218). Zero is a price. Only a NEGATIVE rate is nonsense and still skipped.

    ⚠️ The divisor used to be `_billed_kwh`, which for a HOME charge with a wallbox reading is the
    METER's AC kWh. That priced battery energy at the wall's rate, so the 8-15% the on-board charger
    turns into heat — real money, off your bill — landed on no trip at all and the trip costs summed
    to LESS than what was spent. A trip consumes what is in the pack, so that is what has to be
    divided into. Only home-with-wallbox charges were ever affected: every other charge already had
    the meter and the battery agreeing, because there is no meter (Silvio's call, 31/07/26).
    `_billed_kwh` is a different question and keeps its own answer — the per-charge card, the period
    totals and the €/kWh on the Charges page show what the CHARGER billed (meter, or the figure the
    owner typed from its display). This one divides by what reached the battery, because that is
    what a trip consumes.

    The stock is measured in the DC kWh that reached the pack (`energy_added_kwh`) against the FULL
    cost paid — it has to be an amount the pack can actually hold, and it is what makes "billed +
    left over == spent" come out exact. `_wac_blend` divides on the same basis since 31/07/26, so
    the two agree and the same charge prices a REEV trip and a BEV trip identically.

    Recomputed from history on each call, no stored counter — same reason as `blended_price_at`:
    correct a charge's price months later and every trip after it re-derives itself.

    The counterpart of get_trip_totals_between for the petrol half, so a period card can show BOTH
    energies over the window the reader chose (@michapr, beta #11). getPlugIn already gives the two
    figures measured by the car, but on ITS window and no other — the request carries the VIN and
    nothing else — so a chosen period has to be answered from the trips.

    Not a SQL sum: the litres go through _reev_trip_fuel like everywhere else, which prefers the
    car's OWN counter (signal 3263) and only falls back to tank-% × assumed capacity on trips
    recorded before v2.14.1. ⚠️ A long window therefore mixes the two bases — measured litres for
    recent trips, derived for old ones — and no averaging here can undo that.

    The positions walk that finds the generator-on distance runs ONLY for trips whose tank actually
    dropped, so a mostly-electric REEV (and every BEV) costs one indexed query and nothing more.

    ⚠️ MERGED trips are counted, children included, and that is not an oversight — it was one. This
    was the single fuel total carrying `AND merged_into_id IS NULL`, and joining two trips writes
    that column and NOTHING else: the child keeps the tank reading it was recorded with. So the
    filter deleted the child's litres while `get_trip_totals_between` beside it kept the child's
    kilometres, and the card divided a short numerator by a full denominator. On @michapr's B10
    (beta #23, 05/08/26) his 07:56 trip on 28 July was merged into the 2 km one before it and
    carried 3.7 of his 9.6 L — which is precisely the 5.9 the card kept showing him, through four
    rounds of me looking somewhere else. Parent and child hold DISJOINT tank readings, so summing

    average kWh/100km alongside the official split (mirrors the car's own "since last charge"
    screen, which shows Distanza/Durata/Media next to the same Guida/AC/Altro breakdown).

    `energy_kwh` is Mate's OWN figure for the window — the same per-trip values the Trips page adds
    up, cloud getEC where the cloud had a usable one and the SoC estimate where it didn't. The
    caller uses it as the reference the cloud's period total is checked against (#212). A trip with
    no efficiency counts as 0, which can only make the local total SMALLER — i.e. the check errs
    toward leaving the cloud figure alone.

    `ec_km` is the distance of the trips that HAVE a cloud figure, and it is what an average over
    getEC energy must divide by (beta #40 @michapr). `distance_km` is what the car drove; the two
    differ by every trip the cloud never saw, and dividing one by the other prints an average that
    describes neither. The months already use this basis (`_totals_seal`'s `_ec_km`) and say so on
    the page — "over 395 km of 416".

    `eff_km` is the distance behind `energy_kwh` — the trips that carry an efficiency at all. On a
    range-extender that is the BATTERY-ONLY distance, because Mate blanks the efficiency of every
    trip the generator ran, and the pair is what the Statistics card already divides. It exists
    because `ec_km` is NOT that distance: a mixed trip has a getEC figure, so it lands inside
    `ec_km` while the generator was moving the car past the pack — measured on three owners'
    bundles, the trips with the engine running read 4.8 and 6.5 kWh/100 km against 14.3 and 16.1

    A single charge never takes that variant: its billed figure IS the counter, the typed figure
    or the battery one.

    decides that) and `gross_eff` when the typed figure is not above the battery one. The two thresholds differ at

    Single source of truth so the per-charge card, the period totals, get_charge_stats and the
    Ricariche calendar all agree. The card leads with the same figure (charge_energy_view), and the
    €/kWh on it divides by this. Same order as update_charge_type prices a charge, deliberately: the
    thing that billed you is the thing that delivered.

    ⚠️ The third branch is not a gross figure at all; it is the only number that exists for a charge
    with no meter and nothing typed, and leaving it out would make a month's total drop every time a
    public charge appeared.

    ⚠️ The middle branch means a TYPED number is now part of the energy Mate reports — it was kept
    out on purpose when #222 shipped, so a typo could not inflate a total. Silvio's call, 04/08: the
    Ricariche calendar had started saying "delivered" with the typed figure in it while this one
    still ignored it, and two totals under two words that mean the same thing is worse than one
    total that can be mistyped. It stays out of `_wac_blend`, which divides by the energy that
    actually reached the battery — a trip consumes that, not what the meter saw.

    ⚠️ A plug-in the car reported in PIECES (merged, `_charge_group_stats`) is the sum of the rule
    over its pieces, NOT the rule over the group's summed columns: the meter may have measured one
    piece and dropped the next as implausible (the poller does that), or the pieces may carry
    different types (merging never changes them), and on the summed columns "HOME with a counter"
    billed the metered piece alone — 12 kWh for 12 + 5, the same charge that read 17 before it was
    merged. A typed figure counts once for the pieces it covers (`_gross_figures` says which) —

    set) a measured peak power above 11 kW (AC tops out at ~11 kW; DC is faster). `total`
    counts every finished charge regardless of confirmation — AC vs DC is a measured,
    objective fact the poller already records for all of them, confirmed or not.

    `home_count`/`home_kwh`, `public_count`/`public_kwh` and `unconfirmed_count`/`unconfirmed_kwh`
    are the OTHER, independent axis this feeds (the "Home vs Public" card) — `location_type`, not
    `charge_type`. `home_count + public_count + manual_count + unconfirmed_count` always equals `total`, by
    construction: every charge lands in exactly one.

    ⚠️ NOT nested under `ac` any more, and NOT gated on `is_dc`. It used to be — "every home
    wallbox charges on AC" — which is true almost always, but the type badge itself offers every
    type on every charge regardless of its OWN measured current: pick "Casa" on a DC-measured
    session (a fast home charger, a noisy reading, whatever the real reason) and it was HOME by
    every other measure in Mate, yet vanished from this card entirely — not home, not public, not
    unconfirmed, and the card's own total fell a charge short of the page header's (found in
    review, PR #284: "Ricariche 5" here, "Ricariche 6" on the header, on real test data). Home vs
    Public is answered purely by `location_type`; whether that same charge also happens to be AC or
    DC-measured is a completely separate question, answered by `ac`/`dc` above.

    `public_count`/`public_kwh` are NOT `total - home_count`: unlike AC/DC, "was this at home" is
    unknown for anything not yet confirmed — a charge still `location_type IS NULL`, or stuck on
    the legacy 'MANUAL' placeholder (see the MANUAL/cost_manual split), is neither known-home nor
    known-public, so counting it as public by subtraction silently mislabelled it (found in review:
    a MANUAL charge made at home showed up as "Pubblica"). Only a charge with a real, confirmed,
    non-HOME type counts as public.

    `manual_count`/`manual_kwh` are the charges priced by hand with no type (`is_manual_charge`):
    not public — a Manual charge made at home is not — and not waiting either, because the owner
    already answered with the price (add-on #2).

    `unconfirmed_count`/`unconfirmed_kwh` are that same not-yet-known remainder, made explicit.
    Without it the Home vs Public card's OWN donut (fed only `[home_count, public_count]`) silently
    normalised its percentages against just those two numbers instead of `total`, so on real data
    (1 confirmed public charge, 3 still unconfirmed) the ring showed "100% Pubblica" while the text
    beside it, dividing by `total`, correctly said 25% — two disagreeing numbers on one card, and
    the 3 unconfirmed charges nowhere in it at all (found in review, PR #284)."""

    - **Charges STARTING below `min_start_soc` (default 15%) are shown but excluded** (the *bottom*

    3 decimals used to bucket, so /charges?station=<key> re-selects the identical cluster.

    "frequent place", but a station used once IS the interesting datum here (the charger you
    stopped at on a trip), and dropping singletons would leave a driver who charged at six
    different chargers on one holiday looking at an empty map. top_n alone bounds the payload;
    ties on `sessions` keep get_charges' recency order, so the cap takes the newest one-offs.

    ~2 m apart into different buckets and split one physical station into two markers with
