"""Self-update check: ask the GitHub Releases API for the latest published Mate version and
compare it to the running one, so the UI can show an unobtrusive "update available" badge next
to the version. Best-effort and OFF the request path — the check runs in a background thread on a
TTL and caches its result in `settings`; a page render only READS the cached value (instant, and
works offline / when GitHub is unreachable, it simply shows nothing). No data is sent — it's a
plain public GET of the latest release tag."""

    Reads the cached latest version (instant) and kicks off a background refresh when the cache
    is stale. Never blocks the render or raises.

    The badge means different things depending on how Mate is installed, and pointing everyone
    at the releases page is only right for two of the three:

      * Home Assistant — the Supervisor offers its own Update button; this is just a heads-up.
      * Docker — the user pulls the new image themselves, so the releases page IS the next step.
      * The desktop app — it fetches the new version by itself on the next launch. Sending that
        user to GitHub would offer them a job already done, and in a native window it would
        throw them into a browser full of English release notes for nothing.

    So in the app the badge drops its link and says "restart to apply" instead. The exception is
    an update the app has REFUSED because it is too old to run it (a release that needs newer
    libraries than the bundled ones): that one never arrives on its own, and is the single case
    where the user must actually go and download something.
