Leapmotor API client wrapper.
Uses leapmotor-api 0.3.1, which natively maps the B10/B11 status path to /c10 and
serves the T03 named-field status, so no endpoint patching is needed here. We still
parse the raw signal dict ourselves (_parse_signal) to stay independent of the
library's typed model and insulated from its enum changes.
