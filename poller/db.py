# counted, so the charge was billed on 22.1 kWh instead of 38.9. A rise that is too SMALL always
# looks plausible, which is why the ceiling above never sees it.
#
# What is NOT a safe test: comparing the counter against the charge's DC energy. That figure is
# ΔSoC × the CONFIGURED battery capacity — an estimate resting on a constant the user can set — so
# a car with the capacity typed in wrong would have its perfectly good meter thrown away on every
# single charge. The weaker number must never be allowed to discredit the stronger one.
#
# So the test is between two MEASUREMENTS: the counter stands still while the CAR reports it is
# drawing power. Counted in the kWh the car says it took during the stall rather than in polls,
# because a coarse meter (1 kWh resolution at low power) legitimately sits still for many polls —

# The THIRD way the meter figure goes wrong (#295 @gm27271): the counter was fine and nobody read
# it. His charge was open for twelve hours and read for nineteen minutes of them, so its 7.69 kWh
# was never a measurement of that charge. Watching the meter through a cloud outage closes the door
# that let this happen; Home Assistant itself unreachable, a poller restarted mid-charge while the
# cloud is dark, or a container stopped for hours leave it open, and all three are silent.
#
# Counted in MINUTES, because with no reading there is nothing to count kWh from — and measured
# against our own clock and our own reads, never against the charge's DC energy, for the reason
# spelled out above _WB_STUCK_KWH. Ten minutes is twenty consecutive missed reads at the default

# car far away, so its per-poll creep can accumulate past the 0.05 kWh floor and mislabel a public
# charge as a home/wallbox session. Fix at the root: only attribute the wallbox counter to a charge
# that actually happened AT the wallbox. Its location is learned from the charges where the wallbox
# measured real energy (standby can't reach _WB_HOME_MIN_KWH), median-averaged so a stray GPS fix
