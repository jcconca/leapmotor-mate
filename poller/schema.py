"""The database schema, and the one function that brings a file up to it.

Deliberately a module of its OWN, importing nothing from the rest of Mate. The WEB has to be able to
run this — it reads these tables and until v3.6.6 merely hoped the poller had migrated them, which
cost a 500 on the Charges page and on every trip detail for anyone whose poller had not started.

Its own module rather than an import from `db`, because `poller/db.py` pulls in `crypto` and
`geohash`, and `web/` has files by BOTH of those names — `geohash.py` differs between the two by 64
lines. Reaching into the poller from the web would have loaded the wrong ones under the right names,
and the first attempt at exactly that also put `poller/` ahead of `web/` on the path, so uvicorn
re-imported `poller/main.py` and the web would not boot at all. Nothing here imports anything, so
none of that can happen.
