"""Per-vehicle capability profile — drives model-aware UI/MQTT (show only what the car
actually supports). Verdict per feature: 'working' | 'broken' | 'untested'.

Two AXES per physical feature (proven on the B10): a SENSOR (the car reports the state)
and a COMMAND (we can actuate it remotely) are INDEPENDENT. The comfort family on the B10
is the archetype: the state sensor works (reflects manual activation) but the remote command
is accepted-but-not-executed. So they are SEPARATE features here — e.g. `seat_heat` (sensor,
shown read-only) vs `seat_heat_cmd` (command/button, hidden when broken).

Verdicts:
- 'working'  : proven — a CORE sensor Mate depends on, or the car reports a live non-default
               value, or an at-the-car probe moved the signal.
- 'broken'   : confirmed empirically — command accepted but never actuates, or a sensor never
               changes despite a real state change. These get HIDDEN.
- 'untested' : unknown right now — shown by default (never hide on a guess).

CORE features are NEVER hidden whatever the verdict — hiding them would break Mate's own
trips/charges/reports/charts (gear, speed, odometer, state, charging, SoC, GPS, doors,
tyres, temps…). A 0 right now means parked/closed/idle, not broken.

`kind`:
- 'sensor'  → a read-only state display / MQTT sensor. Hidden only if confirmed 'broken'.
- 'command' → an actuation button. Hidden if confirmed 'broken'.

Stored per VIN in the settings table as JSON under `capabilities_<vin>` — shared by the web
UI and the poller's MQTT bridge (so this module avoids a hard db_reader import: callers in the
poller pass their own get/set via `accessor=`). Accumulates across sessions.
