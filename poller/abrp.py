"""ABRP (A Better Route Planner) live telemetry — optional, opt‑in.

Sends the car's live data to ABRP so it can do live route planning. Off unless the
user enables it and provides their personal ABRP token. The integrator api_key is
the public shared telemetry key used by many community projects, so no per‑app
registration is needed. Stdlib only (urllib) — no extra dependency. Best‑effort:
never raises to the poller loop.
