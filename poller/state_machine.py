Adaptive polling state machine.

States and intervals. There are only TWO cadences, both set by the user in Settings
(`poll_parked` / `poll_driving`, 30s and 10s by default) — every state maps onto one of
them, so the numbers below are which cadence, not a fixed value per state:
  PARKED_SLEEP   parked   — no activity for 30+ min (car sleeping)
  PARKED_ACTIVE  parked   — normal parked, nothing unusual
  PARKED_ALERT   driving  — something changed (door/lock/temp): drive imminent
  DRIVING        driving  — speed > 0 or gear D
  CHARGING       parked   — plugged in
  OFFLINE        parked   — cloud unreachable; keeps the parked cadence (re-login rate-limited 60s)
  UNKNOWN        parked, capped at 30s — before the first successful poll
  (V2L discharge overrides all of them with the driving cadence — see poll_interval.)

Transitions (all independent of HA and phone):
  UNKNOWN/OFFLINE     → PARKED_ACTIVE  first successful poll
  PARKED_SLEEP        → PARKED_ACTIVE  fingerprint changes (any signal)
  PARKED_ACTIVE       → PARKED_ALERT   fingerprint changes
  PARKED_ACTIVE       → PARKED_SLEEP   no change for SLEEP_AFTER_S (30 min)
  PARKED_ALERT        → DRIVING        speed > 0 or gear D
  PARKED_ALERT        → PARKED_ACTIVE  no drive within ALERT_EXPIRES_S (5 min)
  DRIVING             → PARKED_ACTIVE  gear P held ~1 min (6 × 10s), OR cable plugged (trip ends now),
                                       OR the cloud has repeated one "D" frame for 30 min (#233 —
                                       the P readings are never coming, see FROZEN_DRIVE_LIMIT_S)
  ANY_PARKED          → CHARGING       charging_status > 0  (REAL current / 1149==2; NOT the cable alone)
  CHARGING            → PARKED_ACTIVE  no current AND the cable reads gone (1149→0) — a dip with the
                                       cable still connected won't close. NB: a modulating wallbox
                                       makes the car report the cable gone too (see is_charging).
                                       OR: no current and the cloud has repeated one frame for
                                       30 min (#289 — the cable is being read off a photograph,
                                       see FROZEN_CHARGE_LIMIT_S)

# ── REEV-only charge detection ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A range-extender charging in AC at home reports NEITHER of the two things the normal detector
# looks for: the cable state sits at 1 ("connected") instead of 2 ("charging"), and the pack
# current reads ~0.1 A instead of a real charge current. Verified against michapr's B10 (beta
# #12): across 15 days the poller never once entered CHARGING, while the SoC visibly climbed —
# 36.4 → 36.8 % in three minutes with the state stuck on "parked".
#
# So for REEVs only, take the rise itself as the evidence: cable connected, car stationary, and
# the battery genuinely climbing between polls. The SoC-rise requirement is what separates a real
# charge from a SCHEDULED one waiting for its slot (cable connected, remaining-time present, but
# the battery flat) — the case the old comment warns must never open a session.
#
# BEVs are deliberately untouched: they report cable/current correctly and are working today.
#
# Measured against the LOWEST SoC seen since the cable went in, not against the previous poll:
# his battery climbs one 0.1 % step at a time, which is also the SoC's own read resolution, so a
# poll-to-poll test either misses a real charge (threshold above the step) or fires on noise
# (threshold at the step). Accumulating from the low-water mark separates them cleanly — a charge
# keeps adding up, a wobble doesn't.
_REEV_SOC_RISE_PCT = 0.3   # total climb from the low-water mark that means "this is charging"
# End a trip only after the car has been in gear P for ~1 min — matches the HA
# leapmotor_trip automation (gear → P, for: minutes: 1). At the 10s driving poll
# that's 6 readings. Gear-based (not speed) so red lights / brief stops, where the
# gear stays D, never split one drive into many trips.
PARKED_CONFIRM  = 6      # consecutive gear-P readings to end a trip (~1 min @ 10s)

# …and the escape for when those six readings can never arrive (#233, @riri19). Ending a trip needs
# the cloud to SAY gear P. When the cloud instead freezes on a frame that says D — it re-serves the
# last frame it holds, forever — the trip has no way to close: the car is parked in the drive, and
# Mate reports "Driving" for the rest of the day, with the parked hours swallowed into the trip.
#
# Measured on his bundle, 12 days, 40 246 polls: while the car is genuinely moving a fresh frame
# arrives every 18 s (median), 36 s at the 95th percentile and 9.4 min at the 99th — even on a link
# as poor as his. And of the 17 frozen stretches longer than 10 minutes, ALL 17 ended with the
# odometer on the exact value it started at: not one of them was a car still driving.
#
# 30 minutes therefore sits three times beyond the worst gap real driving produces, and still
# catches the eight stretches that left a trip open for one to six hours. Should a car ever really
# be moving through that long a dead zone, the cost is a drive recorded as two, which Mate can
# merge — against a trip that stays open all day, which it cannot.
FROZEN_DRIVE_LIMIT_S = 1800

# …and the same escape for a CHARGE (#289, @juan-conca). The cable term in `is_charging` below is
# what deliberately holds a session open across a wallbox pause — but a sleeping car makes the cloud
# repeat the frame that was true when the current stopped, so that term goes on reading "connected"
# off a photograph. His charge stayed open on ONE frame for just under fifteen hours and closed only
# when the car woke: 1 138 minutes booked for four hours of charging, and no row in the list until
# it closed, because the list filters on `ended_at IS NOT NULL`.
#
# Measured on his bundle, 12 days, 38 412 polls: while current is genuinely flowing the frame is 2 s
# old (median), 5 s at the 95th, 44 s at the 99th and 832 s — 13.9 min — at its worst. Thirty
# minutes sits twice beyond that, and is the same number as the trip guard above.
#
# Only when the frozen frame itself reads NO current: of the 9 224 frozen polls taken while the
# state was CHARGING, not one claimed current. A frozen frame that still reads current is a car
# charging out of reach, whose SoC jumps when it returns — the reconstruction owns that case, and
# this guard leaves it exactly as it is.
