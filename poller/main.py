    @adoewa (#230, 06/08/26): his C10 climbed 49.8% → 90.0% over 3¼ hours with the car demonstrably
    ONLINE — 185 polls, 185 distinct SoC values, frames 2 s old — and Mate opened nothing. The
    bundle could prove the charge happened and could not say WHY it was not recorded, because the
    decision's three inputs were nowhere in the log: the cable's state (1149, via `_is_plugged_in`),
    the decision itself (`_is_charging`), and the pack current (1178). They live in `positions`, one
    row per poll, and in the bundle as a SINGLE snapshot — taken ten hours after the cable came out.

    ⚠️ Measured before adding, over every bundle we hold (7 bundles, 5 cars, 88 car-days): 35
    charges taken while parked, 34 seen, **1 lost**. 2.9%, one car. So this is not a fix for
    something that bites everyone — it is the log carrying enough that the next one is answerable
    at all, whoever it happens to.

    Three fields and no more: this line is written on every poll of every install, ~2900 times a
    day per user. `None` prints as `?`/`—` rather than as 0 — an absent signal is not a zero signal,

    ⚠️ `vin` is what makes the panel belong to the right car. Without it this read the newest row of

    a fan nudge sent to the C10 could carry the T03's mode and target temperature, so asking for more

    Until now this state lived as local variables of `main()` — a recorder, the GPS signs it had
    persisted, two error counters, the last value of every raw signal. That is exactly right for one
    car and silently wrong for two: a single `empty_status_count` means a sleeping car backs off the
    one that is being driven, and a single `_research_last_sig` makes each car's signals look changed
    because the other one wrote them last.

    So the state moves here first, before any second car exists, and nothing else changes. With one
    car this object holds precisely what the locals held and the loop behaves identically — which is
    what makes the step safe to take on its own, provable by the suite that already exists.

    `next_due` is the one genuinely new field: a monotonic deadline per car, so a car being driven
    (10 s) and one parked (30 s) keep their own cadence instead of the whole round running at the
